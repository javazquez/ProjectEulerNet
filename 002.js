/*
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two
terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed
four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

var sum  = 2;
var cur  = 3;
var prev = 2;
while(cur < 4000000){
  next = cur + prev;
  if(next % 2 ===0) sum += next;
  prev = cur;
  cur = next;
}
console.log(sum); //4613732
